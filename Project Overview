Ecommerce-Analytics-Dashboard
End-to-end Ecommerce analytics dashboard built with Python and Tableau
This project analyzes product performance, pricing, customer sentiment, and catalog completeness across a multi-category Ecommerce dataset. The dataset contains detailed product attributes, including ratings, pricing history to determine discount activity, category hierarchy, seller information, and rich catalog content such as images, descriptions, specifications, and variations.

Using Python for data preparation and Tableau for visualization, this project delivers a full end-to-end analytics workflow designed to support decision making in Ecommerce environments similar to Webstaurant, Fanatics, Nike, and other large scale retail operations. The analysis focuses on understanding how customers interact with different categories, how pricing and discount strategies influence engagement, and how catalog quality affects perceived value.

The dashboard is structured into five pages: Executive Overview, Pricing & Engagement, Customer Sentiment, Catalog Completeness, and Brand Performance, each targeting a specific business question and supporting operational, merchandising, and assortment planning decisions.Features were selected based on relevance to the dashboard and analytical necessity


Dataset Summary

Why This Dataset Matters


This type of dataset enables real-world analyses such as:

Understanding which categories drive customer engagement

Evaluating discount effectiveness

Measuring the impact of catalog quality on value perception

Identifying “hero products”

Comparing brands within and across categories

Supporting price optimization and merchandising strategy

The diverse features make it ideal for machine learning models, recommendation systems, and BI dashboard development.


Tools & Workflow


Data preparation and metric calculations were performed in Python (Pandas, NumPy), and all visual analytics were designed in Tableau.

The final workflow includes:

Data Cleaning & Transformation (Python)

Metric Engineering: CSI, RVR, Value Score, Completeness tiers

Dashboard Design (Tableau)

Insight Development & Recommendations

This mirrors the process used by real e-commerce analytics and operations teams.
